          The ILEA requires agencies to report when officers leave agencies, and that data includes whether officers
          resigned, retired, were terminated for misconduct, or any other type of separation. That data is reflected on
          the National Police Index in the &ldquo;employment status&rdquo; column. However, the ILEA cautions that the
          submission of that information by local agencies is not monitored. &ldquo;Discharged&rdquo; generally
          indicates that the officer was terminated or fired, but could have been used to simply denote that they were
          separated. Additional information should be sought from the local agency or ILEA about the circumstances of an
          officer&apos;s separation.
